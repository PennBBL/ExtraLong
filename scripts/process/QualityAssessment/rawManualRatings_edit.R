### After running inspectQCDistns.R, this script was run to second
### guess the exclusion criteria decided by previous manual raters, with the
### discovery that sub-100278 ses-PNC3 is actually a really crappy image. All
### images with more than 250 holes that were not previously excluded were viewed
### to determine if they should remain in the final sample. After this,
### sessionsForANTsSST.R was run.
